	    <h5 class="center">At the atomic level</h5>

            <p class="light">Polar+ protein pruning technology finds the best binding sites on a protein by comparing binding energies at every atom. Not only does this provide strong information for further kinetics modeling, but it also helps in the incorporation of subtler, electromagnetic effects between atoms. This also means that our tool can help complete protein-ligand and large protein-protein models with little setup time. <a target="_untitled" href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.20.000950v3"> Read more about our methodology here </a></p>

            <p class="light"> We model atoms on both real quantum devices and large scale cloud infrastructures utilizing CPUs and GPUs. We have written algorithms and workflows around IBM's, Rigetti's, and DWave's quantum computers, and are currently finishing up work within <a href="https://www.cmc.ca/xanadu-and-cmc-microsystems-approve-development-of-quantum-computing-applications/">Xanadu and CMC's Quantum Sandbox program. </a>.

            <h5 class="center">Built to scale today</h5>

	    <p class="light">Polar+ can process 1 protein when connected to a desktop computer. Or 40. Or 40,000 when connected to a larger server. Our software is built to be scalable for various quantum computing and classical computing resources, because we know results cannot wait for the perfect setup. <a target="_untitled" href="https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Energetics_Based_Modeling_of_Hydroxychloroquine_and_Azithromycin_Binding_to_the_SARS-CoV-2_Spike_S_Protein_-_ACE2_Complex/12015792"> Read about our work with binding analysis with the SARS-COV-2 spike-ACE2 receptor complex here.</a></b></p>
