            <p class="light"> 
            Hi, I'm Kirk, the Chief Strategy Officer for Iff Technologies. My job is a bit more diversified than most CSO's in industry, but working for a cutting-edge crossover biotechnology and quantum technology company sets a higher bar for my performance. I'm not sure that I can entirely cover the dynamic breadth of my position within a few short paragraphs or burdening you readers without a laundrylist of bulletpoints, but I am uniquely qualified for this position due to more than a decade career in grantwriting, project management, game theory, high performance compute architecting, biochemistry, pharmaceutical trials, biomedical devices, econometrics, psychometrics, and a specialized zeal for quantum mechanics, computational complexity, and origami (paper, computational, and protein). If you can handle at least all of these subjects in a single day’s workload, perhaps you could take over my job for me! Otherwise, I’d love to see your approaches to origami regardless.

<br> </br>
On broader strategic endeavors, I like to think that I am enabled to define my company activities for new horizons, but corralling industry, academia, and *shudders* governments is quite the herculean labor, especially for the singularly-unique company that is Iff Technologies. While other quantum companies have been slow to plant the seeds of industry in quantum economic development, we at Iff have been harvesting use case kernels day by day through genuinely innovative crossover applications. And while it is also true that many other companies have active scientists par excellence, at Iff Technologies we have advanced use cases built into the business models by design that set our company apart from the rest. Our leading business practices are intrinsically quantum, and as our company ambition is taglined, "for quantum, by quantum” is our genuine quantum advantage where we shine.

<br> </br>
You can find me often at Quantum Economic Development Consortium meetings spearheading various biomedical use cases for quantum technologies across the nation as well as coordinated with international agencies, or at particular quantum-focused conferences that aim to bridge R&D gaps between biomedical, clinical, and patient-oriented services for our company’s largest interests. However, I would be remiss to not mention that we have also been championing specialized financial applications of quantum technologies and algorithms in particularly-crucial global sectors such as vaccine development and distribution, biopharmaceutical derisking, supply-side commodity stabilization, and optimistically for near-term financial products with either quantum-inspired or quantum information scientific (QIS) advantages. I have dealt with a lot of career grantwriting, especially Small Business Innovation Research and Technology Transfer grants from various federal agencies, and offloading some of these work burdens algorithmically would be particularly enabling as a technological advantages, so I am professionally motivated in helping to develop these products over the next several years in various ways with the resources and experiences that I have accrued.

If you can’t find me in the wild for a coffee chat, please email me at the website contact info if you have some development or germane topical content to discuss strategically with our company, and I will happily dedicate some serious time to looking into mutually-beneficial issues that you can bring to my attention (provided I haven’t already reached out to you first).
