           <p> To determine the relationship solid tumors and COVID-19, ontologies, which are groupings of terms and related identifiers, such as genes, were created for general search terms, utilizing the Human Phenotype Ontology. They were then combined with “COVID-19” and used as search terms in Twitter’s Standard Search tool. The keywords with the most matches were then queried through clinicaltrials.gov and European Bioinformatics Institute’s (EBI) Protein Search Tool to find relevant clinical trials and proteins. Finally, the proteins found by the EBI protein search were run through the SwissModel Tool to find relevant protein structures before being used in binding Iff Technologies' protein binding tool, which provides K values related to 50% inhibition for each medication or immunotherapy. This produced a set of disease-specific keywords that are related to top tweets, clinical trials, protein structures, and binding concentration values in relevant biomolecular pathways for the keyword set “Tumor COVID-19”. </p>

           <p> With the rise of social media use during the COVID-19 pandemic, impressions from online content can affect behavioral changes resulting in exacerbating disparities in care. Thus, there exists a need to utilize social media platforms, like Twitter, to help augment preparedness, especially at the intersection between oncology and COVID-19, where tweets could help hint at potential biomolecular interactions.
To address this, a study was developed to assess relationship and ontologies on the interaction between hematological malignancies and COVID-19 on Twitter. </p>
